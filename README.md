## How do I navigate your GitHub profile? 
Well, we can group my repositories into these categories:
- [Simulations](https://github.com/alpbintug/alpbintug#simulations)
- [Analysis](https://github.com/alpbintug/alpbintug#analysis)
- [Computer Science](https://github.com/alpbintug/alpbintug#computer-science)
- [Image Processing](https://github.com/alpbintug/alpbintug#image-processing)
- [Programming Language Trainings](https://github.com/alpbintug/alpbintug#programming-language-trainings)

- [Other Applications](https://github.com/alpbintug/alpbintug#other-applications)


## Repository Categories
    
### Simulations

These repositories mainly focuses on simulating how algorithms work in different situations.
- [Game of Life Simulation: (WITH GIF)](https://github.com/alpbintug/Game-of-life) written in MATLAB, simulates Conway's Game of Life with random starting states. Resulting GIF is included in the repository, and it is pronounced GIF not JIF, anyone saying that "it is pronounced JIF" will be excomunicated.
- [Ant Simulation with Genetic Algorithm: (WITH VIDEO)](https://github.com/alpbintug/Ant-Simulation-With-Genetic-Algorithm) simulates how ants act in the real world, how they search for food, lead others to food and find their way back to the colony. Ants have different attributes (Speed, Carrying capacity, etc.) and Genetic Algorithm is used to determine which generation is better fit to find and carry food back to their colony.
- [Drone Scanning Simulation with Genetic Algorithm:](https://github.com/alpbintug/Drone-Scanning-Simulation) simulates how N drones scan an area with maximum efficiency.
- [Map Thingy with Vehicles:](https://github.com/alpbintug/Map-Thingy-With-Vehicles) simulates how vehicles move from point A to point B using existing roads. And this repository has the best name - and this is not a subject for discussion.

### Analysis
These repositories focuses on analysing data - or statistical phenomenons.
- [Experiments on Various Statistical Distributions:](https://github.com/alpbintug/experiments-on-various-statistical-distributions) analyses how given statistical distributions (binomial, exponential, poisson, etc.) work on the real world.
- [Analysis on Karabakh Conflict:](https://github.com/alpbintug/Azerbaijan-Armenia-Conflict-Country-Support-Calculation) analyses how countries reacted to the conflict based on the news they released and which countries support which side in this particular conflict.
- [Analysis on Kickstarter Data:](https://github.com/alpbintug/Analysis-On-Kickstarter-Data) analyses what makes a Kickstarter project successful, gives you tips and tricks. Based on the dataset from Kaggle.
- [Analysis on Bike Sharing Demand Data](https://github.com/alpbintug/Bike-sharing-demand-analysis) analyses which variables cause higher demand for bike sharing. Based on the dataset from Kaggle.

### Computer Science
Working on different stuff, ranging from algorithms to computer graphics
- [Branchless Programming](https://github.com/alpbintug/Branchless-programming) explains why you shouldn't use branches and how to cleanse this heresy.
- [Learning OpenGL](https://github.com/alpbintug/LearningOpenGL) tutorial on how to make an colorfully flashing Pepe the Frog image.
- [Experiments on Cython](https://github.com/alpbintug/experiments-on-cython) trying out Cython, which tries to make Python as fast as C.
- [C with Classes](https://github.com/alpbintug/C-With-Classes) trying to implement classes to plain C.
- [Homeworks and Thingies](https://github.com/alpbintug/Homeworks-And-Thingies) homeworks from different classes of being a CE student.
- [Algorithms](https://github.com/alpbintug/Algorithms) implementation of different algorithms using C programming language.
- [Codewars Solutions](https://github.com/alpbintug/Codewars-Solutions) my specialized solutions to different problems in Codewars. DO NOT CHECK THEM UNLESS YOU COMPLETED THE PROBLEMS YOURSELF.
- [Project Euler](https://github.com/alpbintug/Project-Euler) same as above, but Project Euler.
- [Key-Lock matcing](https://github.com/alpbintug/Key-Lock-matching) matching two arrays index by index, one of them consists of keys, other consists of locks.
- [Social Network with Binary Tree](https://github.com/alpbintug/Minor-Social-Network-Using-Binary-Tree) a simple binary tree database for social network, stores ✨*friendship*✨status of each user.

### Image Processing
Not everything processes images, but trying to capture one is also _processing_, right?
- [Irregular Rectangle Cropper](https://github.com/alpbintug/irregular-rectangle-image-cropper) crops a section in given image and turns it into a regular rectangle. Great for fixing tilted photos.
- [Screen Recorder](https://github.com/alpbintug/ScreenRecorder) records your screen, as advertised. But I am not satisfied with the results because the framerates are too low -about 25FPS- for my taste.
- [AoE II Minimap Magnifier](https://github.com/alpbintug/age-of-empires-ii-minimap-magnifier) we were playing Age of Empires with friends, I wanted to flex on them with increasing my minimap awareness, therefore I created this to magnify the minimap and project it onto my seconds screen. Yeah it is cheating, but I coded it so it is cool.
- Game of Life is _technically_ a image processing project because it works as cellular automaton but w/e.

### Programming Language Trainings
If you are beginner, this might help you but mostly I use these repositories as dumpster.
- [The Allfather: C Programming Language](https://github.com/alpbintug/C-Examples) C is the superior one. Do not question him.
- [Java++: C#](https://github.com/alpbintug/C-Sharp-Examples) please stop using Java when you can use C#, I beg you. Why do you want to torture yourself by writing 400 words to use a constructor...
- [The Forbidden one: Java itself](https://github.com/alpbintug/Java-Examples) please do not open this...
- [Rising star of Data Science: Julia](https://github.com/alpbintug/JuliaLangTraining) it is ✨*rising*✨, so only one example about its variables.
- [Popular kid: Python](https://github.com/alpbintug/Python-Examples) this is pretty old, please do not judge me based on this...

### Mobile Programming
My school projects but for Android
- [Wardrobe App (WITH VIDEO)](https://github.com/alpbintug/Mobil-Programlama-Proje) lets you select clothes, organize them, and WEAR THEM ON YOUR MODEL. AND YOU CAN SHARE HOW IT LOOKS WITH YOUR FRIENDS? THIS IS INSANE OMG!!! Jk. It looks ugly but the idea is there.
- [Exam Generation App (WITH VIDEO)](https://github.com/alpbintug/Mobil-Programlama-Odev) you can create exams with plain text or image, add choices and score it, then convert it into text and share with whoever you want.

### Other Applications
This section only contains my messaging app - for now.
- [Whatsapp Jr.](https://github.com/alpbintug/Whatsapp-Jr) you can search for users, add them as contacts , if they also add you, you can send and receive messages over Firebase of Google. This was an attempt to learn how Firebase works. Do not set your expectations too high.
